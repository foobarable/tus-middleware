Node.js resumable upload middleware for [express](http://expressjs.com/)/[connect](https://github.com/senchalabs/connect) implementing the [tus resumable upload protocol](http://tus.io/protocols/resumable-upload.html).
This repo is a fork from the middleware implementation of Niklas von Hertzen. So far, it does not support the tus protocol version 1.0.0. The aim of this project is to do so.

## Installation

    $ npm install tus

## Usage

To attach the resumable upload middleware to express or connect, create an upload server by calling `createServer` passing it an `options` object. Available options are:

 - **directory** - String - Path where to upload the files (required)
 - **maxFileSize** - Number - Maximum file size for uploads, in bytes (optional)
 - **complete** - Function - Callback to inform when a file (all chunks) have been uploaded. Passes the request and response streams, with the metadata assigned to the `upload` property within the request. The response must be handled manually if a complete callback is used. (optional)
 - **path** - String - Override path to be returned for Location header when creating new files, for example if you proxy forward requests to a different host/path (optional)
 
Example:

```js
var express = require("express"),
    upload = require("tus");

var app = express();
var port = 3000;

app.use("/files", upload.createServer({
    directory: __dirname + "/uploads",
    maxFileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 5 // 5 mb,
    complete: function(req, res, next) {
        console.log("File uploaded with the following metadata:", req.upload);
        res.send(200);
    }
}));

app.listen(port);
```
